## Platform

adaptive

Web is the mature surface today (`apps/web-player`, `apps/web-artists`). The Expo app
(`apps/mobile`, roadmap v0.5.0) and the Tauri app (`apps/desktop`, roadmap v1.2.0) are
scaffolded but unstarted. `adaptive` is a decision about where this product is going: the
mobile surface is expected to read as native on each OS rather than inherit web
conventions, so native platform guidance applies to its design work when it begins.

## Users

**Listeners — primary.** People who want to play music: browse, search, build and manage
playlists, like tracks/albums/playlists, follow artists, and return to what they were
recently playing. Served by `apps/web-player` (Next.js, port 3001), later by the mobile and
desktop apps. This is the audience the product's success is measured against.

**Artists — secondary, early.** Musicians publishing to the platform: upload tracks and
metadata, maintain a public artist page, and (roadmap v0.6.0) read analytics on plays,
followers, and geography. Served by `apps/web-artists` (port 3002), which today implements
only the auth surface — login, registration, forgot/reset password. Artists have their own
credentials, OAuth, and account model, separate from listener accounts.

**Operators — internal.** Staff uploading catalog, managing artists and users, and
moderating content. There is no operator surface today: the Kottster admin panel was removed
(ADR-0025) and nothing replaced it, so these tasks go through the API or the database
directly. Its needs are throughput and correctness, not persuasion.

## Product Purpose

A music streaming platform: listeners find and play music, artists publish it and see how
it lands, operators keep the catalog healthy. This is built to reach real listeners and
real artists — the roadmap's monetization, app-store submission, GDPR, and security-audit
milestones are commitments, not aspirations. Design decisions should assume real accounts,
real uploaded audio, real listening sessions, and eventually real money.

Success means a listener can find something and play it without friction, come back to it
later, and keep a library that feels like theirs — on whichever surface they opened.

## Positioning

**Undecided, and deliberately recorded as undecided.** The product currently reimplements a
familiar streaming model faithfully; no differentiating mechanism or claim has been
established that a neighboring product could not truthfully copy. The v1.0.0-rebranding
milestone is where a real position is expected to be decided.

Until then: do not invent a differentiator, and do not write marketing copy that asserts
one. Surfaces that need a position (a landing page, a pricing page, store listings) require
this question to be answered first, not assumed.

## Operating Context

- **Listening is rarely the foreground task.** The player runs while people work, commute,
  cook, or study. Controls get partial attention, glanced at rather than read.
- **Sessions are long and re-entrant.** People return to the same library, the same recents,
  the same liked songs. Continuity across visits matters more than first-run impact.
- **The catalog is real audio.** Tracks are uploaded, processed through a BullMQ pipeline,
  and streamed as HLS at 128/192/320 kbps Opus. Cover art, avatars, and audio are served as
  real media, not placeholders — `mediaUrl` helpers resolve and fall back on them.
- **Two account worlds, one catalog.** Listener accounts and artist accounts are distinct
  (separate auth, separate apps). An artist page a listener browses is the public face of an
  account that lives in a different application.
- **Multi-surface by design.** Web, mobile, and desktop are intended to be the same product.
  A concept introduced on one surface will need an answer on the others.

## Capabilities and Constraints

**Shipped (roadmap-confirmed):**
- JWT auth (access + refresh), OAuth 2.0 via Google and Facebook, for both listeners and
  artists; TOTP two-factor with QR and backup codes; email password recovery.
- Audio upload and processing pipeline; HLS streaming at three bitrates; track and album
  CRUD; static file serving.
- Like/unlike for tracks, albums, and playlists; follow/unfollow artists; listening history;
  playlist management with owner permissions.
- Full-text search across tracks, artists, albums, and playlists (PostgreSQL FTS + GIN).

**Built but incomplete — UI lags the API.** Several capabilities exist server-side with the
listener-facing UI still unbuilt: search page, artist page, album page, listening-history
view, public user profiles, profile editing, follow-users, activity feed. Media player
transport itself (play/pause/seek/next/prev, volume, progress, queue, shuffle, repeat, HLS
quality switching) is the current v0.3.0 focus and not yet complete. Treat "the API supports
it" as a reason a surface is worth designing, not as evidence it already works.

**Not started:** mobile app beyond scaffolding, desktop app beyond scaffolding, artist
analytics and verification, monetization/subscriptions, lyrics, trending/charts, gapless
playback, equalizer, offline mode, podcasts/audiobooks, recommendations.

**Technical constraints that bind design work:**
- Web UI is Next.js App Router with Feature-Sliced Design; imports flow
  `app → views → widgets → features → entities → shared`.
- All design values are hand-written Tailwind v4 `@theme` layers in
  `packages/ui-react/src/styles/` — there is no generator and no `tokens.json`, see
  ADR-0023. Hardcoded color, spacing, radius, shadow, breakpoint, and
  z-index values are not permitted — a missing role gets a named token, not an arbitrary
  utility.
- Theme switching swaps token values; components do not fork into separate light/dark trees.
- Server state lives in TanStack Query; cross-component client state in Zustand. The API
  contract is generated from Swagger into `@bitrate/contracts` — the UI cannot invent
  endpoints.
- **No i18n runtime is wired.** `apps/web-artists` ships a `SwitchLanguages` UI shell with
  no `next-intl`/`i18next` dependency behind it. Do not design flows that assume working
  language switching, and do not describe the product as localized.

**Terminology:** *track*, *album*, *playlist*, *artist*, *liked songs*, *library*,
*recents*. Listener-facing routes live under `/main`; artist auth under `/auth`.

## Brand Commitments

**The product is Bitrate — all-in-one for musicians.** [`apps/docs/docs/brand/`](apps/docs/docs/brand/) is the source of truth for
positioning, promise, tone, and the product decision filter; the sibling `design.md` translates
it into design rules. Read those before making a naming, copy, or visual decision here — this section
only records what binds the codebase.

Settled: the name **Bitrate**, the `@bitrate/*` package namespace, and the brand primary
**Bitrate Purple `#7C3AED`** with three themes (dark, light, dim).

Resemblance to the incumbent is not a requirement, a safety net, or a review criterion. The
inherited Spotify-derivative surfaces — palette, logo, marketing copy carried over into
`apps/web-artists` — are being removed, not preserved. Deliberately still open per
`design.md` §24: the final logo and mark, typography, the spacing scale, illustration and
photography direction, motion tokens, and the icon family.

The name remains subject to trademark, domain, and legal clearance before irreversible
investment (`apps/docs/docs/brand/voice.md` § Naming), so identifiers that would claim a `bitrate.*` domain stay
owner-namespaced for now.

## Evidence on Hand

**Real:**
- Deployed web player — https://bitrate.me, with the artists portal at https://artists.bitrate.me
- Storybook for the shared component library — https://ui.bitrate.me
- Documentation site — https://docs.bitrate.me
- Live API at https://api.bitrate.me with the Swagger contract at `/swagger`; generated types in
  `@bitrate/contracts`
- Icon set and design tokens in `packages/ui-react/` (icons, palette, themes, typography)
- Seeded development data with genuinely downloaded audio files and cover images
  (`apps/api/src/infra/seeds/`) — usable as realistic content in comps, though the artist
  and user names are Faker-generated, not real people
- Public GitHub repository and Projects board (Lordpluha/projects/6)
- Docusaurus documentation site with architecture ADRs and brand contracts

**Absent — must not be fabricated:**
- No users, no listener numbers, no play counts, no artist roster
- No testimonials, reviews, press, case studies, or named customers
- No pricing, no subscription tiers, no monetization (roadmap "Future 2027+")
- No product name, logo, or brand identity
- No app-store presence
- No company, team, or founding story

## Product Principles

1. **Playback is the product; everything else is navigation.** When a decision trades away
   the immediacy or reliability of getting sound out of the speakers, it loses.
2. **Design for the return visit, not the first one.** Library, recents, and liked songs are
   where a real listener actually lives. A surface that only impresses on first load has
   optimized for the wrong session.
3. **Partial attention is the default.** The listener is doing something else. Controls must
   survive a glance, a reach, and a wrong tap.
4. **Ship the honest state.** The API supporting a feature does not mean the feature works.
   Empty, loading, processing, and failed states are part of the design, not cleanup — the
   catalog is real audio moving through a real pipeline that can be slow or fail.
5. **Claim nothing the product cannot back.** With no users, no pricing, and no position
   decided, copy that implies scale, endorsement, or a market claim is a defect.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

WCAG 2.2 Level AA is the repository target for user-facing web UI, and accessibility
regressions are treated like failing tests. The full contract lives in
`apps/docs/docs/brand/a11y.md`; the binding points for design work:

- Text contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (large text ≥ 3:1); component boundaries and focus indicators
  ≥ 3:1 against adjacent colors, verified in **both** dark and light themes.
- Information is never carried by color alone.
- Every pointer action is keyboard operable; focus order follows reading order; focus
  indicators stay visible; overlays trap focus only while open and return it to the trigger.
- Native elements before ARIA. Icon-only controls carry accessible names.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected.
- Interactive targets ≥ 24 × 24 CSS px or equivalently spaced.
- Layout remains usable at 320 CSS px and 400% zoom without losing content or actions.

No audience-specific accessibility need beyond this standard has been established. Note that
a music product has an obvious one worth confirming later: the platform has no captions,
transcripts, or lyrics surface, so audio content is currently unavailable to deaf and
hard-of-hearing users. Lyrics are on the roadmap (v0.9.0, unstarted) and are not currently
framed as an accessibility commitment.
