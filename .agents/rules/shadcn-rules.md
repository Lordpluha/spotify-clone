description: Project-specific shadcn/ui-react overrides — where component source, barrels, and config live in packages/ui-react, the search-before-adding workflow, Base UI as the primitive library, and where the generic shadcn skill's defaults are overridden. Use whenever adding, searching for, or modifying a UI component in packages/ui-react, or whenever the generic shadcn skill's guidance conflicts with this package's existing source.

# shadcn rules — `@spotify/ui-react`

The generic shadcn skill is linked at `.claude/skills/shadcn/`. This file records the
spotify-clone overrides; when guidance conflicts, this file and the existing package source
win.

## Ownership and config

- Config: `packages/ui-react/components.json`
- Component source: `packages/ui-react/src/components/ui/<kebab-name>/`
- Component barrel: `packages/ui-react/src/components/ui/index.ts`
- Package barrel: `packages/ui-react/src/index.ts`
- Class helper: `cn` from `packages/ui-react/src/lib/utils.ts`
- Primitive library: Base UI (`@base-ui-components/react`)
- Consumer import: `import { Button } from '@spotify/ui-react'`

The existing `components.json` contains legacy Tailwind/shadcn fields. Inspect generated
diffs carefully; package source, Tailwind v4 setup, and design-token pipeline are
authoritative.

## Before creating a component

1. Search existing exports and component folders.
2. Search the shadcn registry through the CLI and read current component docs. MCP is
   disabled by default in `.mcp.json` for token budget; use it only if enabled locally.
3. Prefer composition from existing `@spotify/ui-react` components.
4. Add a new primitive only when no existing component or composition fits.

Run CLI commands from `packages/ui-react/`:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest info
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest search @shadcn -q "<need>"
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest docs <component>
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <component> --dry-run
```

Never overwrite an existing component without explicit approval. Use `--diff` and merge
upstream changes while preserving local variants and tests.

## Package component shape

```text
components/ui/<name>/
  <name>.tsx
  <name>.stories.tsx
  <name>.unit-spec.tsx
  <name>.int-spec.tsx
  <name>.snapshot-spec.tsx
  <name>.screenshot-spec.tsx
  index.ts
```

Not every first draft needs every test file, but public primitives should converge on this
matrix. Export through the local barrel and `components/ui/index.ts`.

## Project-specific rules

- Component APIs are project-owned. Inspect the installed source before applying generic
  Base UI or Radix advice. For example, the current `Button` intentionally exposes
  `asChild` through the package's `Slot` helper.
- Use design tokens generated from `packages/tokens/tokens.json`.
- Use `cn()` and CVA for variants.
- Use icons from `@/icons` or the package's configured icon source before adding another
  icon library.
- Forms compose the existing package primitives (`Form`, `InputGroup`, `InputContext`,
  `InputWithLabel`, etc.) and React Hook Form + Zod.
- Toasts use the existing `Sonner` export.
- New UI code needs Storybook coverage and tests proportional to behaviour.

Known overrides to the generic skill:

| Generic guidance | spotify-clone convention |
|---|---|
| Base UI triggers always use `render` | Follow the installed component API; `Button` currently supports `asChild` |
| Button has no loading prop | Existing `Button` has `isLoading`; preserve compatibility unless intentionally redesigning it |
| Generic flat component destination | Use `components/ui/<kebab-name>/<name>.tsx` plus local and package barrels |
| Generic icon library assumption | Prefer generated `@/icons` and existing package icons |
| Generic form primitives | Reuse the form/input primitives already exported by `@spotify/ui-react` |

After adding or updating a component:

```bash
pnpm --filter @spotify/ui-react check-types
pnpm --filter @spotify/ui-react lint
pnpm --filter @spotify/ui-react test:unit
pnpm --filter @spotify/ui-react test:int
```

Run snapshot/screenshot updates only when the output change is intentional.
